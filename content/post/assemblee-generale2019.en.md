The general assembly of Exodus Privacy took place on Saturday, September 14th 2019 in Nantes. This was the occasion for us to spend some time together, look back upon the past year and have a chat about our future projects.

## An association trying to turn towards the general public

Exodus Privacy has existed for less than two years. [The 2018 General Assembly](/en/post/assemblee-generale2018/) allowed us to turn back on our first year of existence, marked by the garnering of undeniable visibility and scientific credibility. The year 2018-2019, for its part, let us rely on our tools and competences to turn ourselves more towards the general public.

To this end, we created, among others, a more accessible version of our speeches and we presented it to a non-technical audience as well as digital mediators. We also translated our website and our platform in French, while they only were available in English before.

We also began the ambitious project of improving our platform design, in order to make it more easily understandable and usable, thanks to precious help from [Maitané Lenoir](https://www.maiwann.net/), UX designer. We should be able to tell you more about this before the end of the year. In the same vein, the financial support from [Code Lutin](http://www.codelutin.com/) is going to allow us to undertake a similar project on the Android application, thanks to Maitané Lenoir's and [Anthony Chomienne](https://mob-dev.fr)'s work.

We keep being sought by medias on a regular basis, as shown by [the selection of articles](/en/page/press/) mentioning our work.

## Healthy finances... up to this point

Exodus Privacy only operates on donations and spends little. We receive [precious support](/en/page/supporters/), notably from [Gandi](https://gandi.net) providing us with credits for our web hosting.

Our most important expense item was the payment of Maitané Lenoir's work. We were able to afford it thanks to a one-time donation from Qwant dating from March 2018.

Even if our finances are healthy, we are going in the upcoming months to reflect upon conceiving a donation campaign, depending on our projects and our needs.

As a reminder, [all of our accounting is available online](/en/post/comptabilite-2019/).

## Making our statutes more inclusive

We also modified our statutes in order to make them more inclusive and integrate our [Code of conduct](/en/page/who/). They will be published on our website soon.

## Electing our Bureau

Lastly, we elected the new bureau, constituted like last year of the following persons: U+039b, pnu, Lovis_IX (Treasurer), Codimp (Secretary) et MeTaL_PoU (President).
