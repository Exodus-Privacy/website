Today Exodus Privacy launched his own forum. You can join us at <https://forum.exodus-privacy.eu.org>. As this forum is under French law, any author of discriminatory comments will be banned without mercy. Please be kind with everybody.

We are proud to announce a Firefox and Chrome extension made by a fan. This extension provides, in the Play Store, the number of trackers of the application you are looking at and some alternative applications. You just need to make your own choice between privacy and features. <https://github.com/FacettsOpen/exodify>
