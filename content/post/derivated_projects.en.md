Some of our fans use their talent to create third parts using Exodus Privacy's data (with the API).

* Exodify: a browser add-on to see the list of trackers embedded in AndroidÂ© applications within the Google Play web interface. Get direct access to Exodus Privacy reports right from Google Play store!

The add-on is available on:

* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/exodify/)
* [Chrome/Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/exodify/imfbjeceaelpdlhbeembaocakecajhlm)

{{< fig src="/media/post/derivated_projects/capture-playstore.png" caption="Screenshot of Exodify">}}

You can download Exodify directly from your browser in the add-on preferences or see the project source at [https://github.com/FacettsOpen/exodify](https://github.com/FacettsOpen/exodify)

Note: This is a non-exhautive list, we can only list known projects. If you want to be in this list please [email us](mailto:bureau@xodus-privacy.eu.org).
