In the time of COVID-19, we thought it would be necessary to give you some news of εxodus…

### Tracking applications

In the last weeks, we have witnessed an increase of tracking applications linked to the COVID-19 on the Google Play Store. **Unfortunately, εxodus is not able to download applications with geographic restrictions.** Therefore, the majority of these tracking apps cannot be scanned by our platform.

We invite you to read the analysis reports generated - partly using our tools - by our friends from Defensive Lab Agency: https://forensic.defensive-lab.agency/covid/

If you have the time and the required skill, note that the tool [εxodus-standalone](https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/exodus-standalone) is also available. It would allow you to analyze the apps yourself, after downloading the application on your computer.

### Derogation applications

In certain countries such as France where a derogation is required in order to go out, some applications have appeared on the Google Play Store to "facilitate" their redaction / usage. If these apps (downloaded more than 100.000 times) seem to bring new features in comparison to the official governement website, they still present risks, [as demonstrated here (in French) by Defense Lab Agency](https://twitter.com/defensive_lab/status/1249350060606926849).

Note that Google has since taken the decision to remove these applications from the Play Store, providing the following justification:

> *"We don’t allow apps that lack reasonable sensitivity towards or capitalize on a natural disaster, atrocity, conflict, death, or other tragic event"*

We would like to remind you that **a good practice before installing an application is to check what it contains** with [εxodus](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org) or [exodify](https://github.com/FacettsOpen/exodify/). You can [analyze it](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/analysis/submit/) if it is not already present to add it to our database.

Lastly, note that a list of tools and things you can do to better manage your privacy on your smartphone is available directly on the εxodus platform: https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/info/next/

Take care of yourselves!
