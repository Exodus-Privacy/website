You may have seen it on one of our Twitter and Mastodon posts: we now have a Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/exodusprivacy/).
Why Facebook?
For a technical discussion, Mastodon and IRC are perfect. But Exodus Privacy wants to reach out to the general public. To raise awareness of tracking issues, it is essential to meet him.
For the same reason, we're going to open a YouTube channel.

The purpose of this page is obviously not to make the buzz, but simply to make it easy to find us.

No volunteers were hurt during the creation of the page, their data had already been siphoned off by Cambridge Analytica.
