title: "Why do you have a YouTube channel when this platform belongs to Google?"
---

The goal of Exodus Privacy is to reach as many people as possible, the least tech-savvy and the most inclined to ignore what's happening in their smartphone. To reach this audience, it is necessary to go to it, because it will not come to us. So we have a YouTube channel and a Facebook page. Do not worry, we also have a Peertube channel.

You can find the links of our different media on [this page](/en/page/what/#videos).
