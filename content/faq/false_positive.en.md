title: "Are there any false positives and/or false negatives in your reports?"

Our static detection method looks in applications for the presence of a defined list of trackers. If the signature of a tracker is detected in the analysis, its presence is indicated in the report. This is not a proof of activity of these trackers.

In addition, the application could contain one or more trackers we did not identify yet. We therefore do not guarantee the completeness of this list.
