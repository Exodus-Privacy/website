title: "How are the applications analyzed?"
--- 

We do not decompile applications, as this is not allowed. We perform a static analysis of APKs and compare Java class names with a list of trackers. If there is a match, then the tracker is present. A more detailed description is available in [this post](/en/post/exodus_static_analysis/).
